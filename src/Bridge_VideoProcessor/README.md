# Video Processor | Bridge Design Pattern

## Introduction

This project is a simple example of Bridge Design Pattern. Bridge allows us to separate abstraction and implementation into two hierarchies. This way, we can change the abstraction and implementation independently of each other.
Here we have a VideoProcessor class that has a reference to a VideoProcessor implementation. We can change the type of processor without changing the VideoProcessor class.

## Getting Started

To use this code, you need to have a Java IDE installed on your machine. I used InteliJ IDE for Java Developers. You can download it from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows).
Also, you need to have Java installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/).

## Running the tests

To run the tests, you need to run the main method in the Main class.
