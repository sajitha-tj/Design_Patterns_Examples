# Shape Creator | Prototype Design Pattern

## Introduction

This project is a simple shape creator that uses the Prototype Design Pattern to create new shapes.
Here, the Shape is the Prototype and the Circle, Rectangle and Square are the Concrete Prototypes.
We can create new shapes by cloning the existing shapes.

## Getting Started

To use this code, you need to have a Java IDE installed on your machine. I used InteliJ IDE for Java Developers. You can download it from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows).
Also, you need to have Java installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/).
