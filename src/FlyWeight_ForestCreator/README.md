# Forest Creator | FlyWeight Design Pattern

## Introduction

This project is a simple example of the FlyWeight Design Pattern. The FlyWeight Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows us to share common parts of an object between multiple objects. This is done to reduce the memory footprint of the application. In this example, we will be creating a some tree objects which have a position, type, colour, withFruits attributes.
Here type, colour and withFruits attributes are shared amoung Trees, therefore we use a flyweight to store these attributes and share them between the trees.

## Getting Started
