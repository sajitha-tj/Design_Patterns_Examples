# DBconnection | Singleton Design Pattern

## Introduction

This project is a simple example of Singleton Design Pattern. Here, we have a DBconnection class that has a private constructor and a static method to get the instance of the class. This way, we can make sure that there is only one instance of the class.

In multi-threaded applications, we need to make sure that there is only one instance of the class. To do so, we can use the synchronized keyword in the getInstance method. This way, we can make sure that only one thread can access the method at a time.

## Getting Started

To use this code, you need to have a Java IDE installed on your machine. I used InteliJ IDE for Java Developers. You can download it from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows).
Also, you need to have Java installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/).

## Running the tests

To run the tests, you need to run the main method in the Main class.
