# Design Patterns Examples

This project consists some simple examples of design patterns in Java.
These examples will help you to understand the design patterns better.
Examples are written in Java and you can find the source code in the src folder.
Each example has a README.md file that explains the example briefly.


## Getting Started

To use codes in this project, you need to have a Java IDE installed on your machine. I used InteliJ IDE for Java Developers. You can download it from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows).
Also, you need to have Java installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/).

## Running the tests

To run the tests, you need to run the main method in the each example's Main class.
